# Average Calculator - Project

A responsive, web-based average calculator featuring light and dark themes, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Interactive Average Calculator ðŸ§®

This repository contains a fully functional, browser-based average calculator. Developed using standard front-end technologies.

## Overview

The Interactive Average Calculator is a sleek, user-friendly web application designed to quickly and accurately compute the arithmetic mean of an arbitrary set of numbers. Built using the fundamental web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a dynamic and intuitive experience that adapts to the user's specific calculation needs.

## Key Features & Functionality

This project is engineered around a simple, three-step workflow to ensure maximum efficiency and ease of use:

- Dynamic Input Initialization: The application begins by prompting the user to specify the total quantity of elements they wish to average. This initial input dynamically sets up the subsequent data entry phase.
- Sequential Data Entry: Following initialization, the user is presented with a clear interface to input each number one by one. This guided approach minimizes data entry errors and ensures all necessary values are captured.
- Instantaneous Calculation: Once all elements have been entered, the core JavaScript logic processes the input to calculate and display the final arithmetic average instantly.

## Benefits

- Customizable: Effortlessly handles averages for any number of elements, from two to hundreds.
- Accessible: A clean, web-based interface makes it accessible across all modern browsers and devices.
- Educational: Provides a practical, real-world example of dynamic user interaction and data processing using core JavaScript principles.

This project is a strong demonstration of foundational front-end development skills, emphasizing user-centered design and efficient algorithmic implementation.
